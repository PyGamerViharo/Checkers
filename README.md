# Checkers
Play checkers in python, either against AI or another person!

To play, go to the page where you see this file and click "Clone" or "Code" on the top - right hand side. Then download to zip folder, extract it and run main.py from either Double_player or Single_Player!

Please leave your feedback in the comments, star the project and follow me!
